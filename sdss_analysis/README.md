# SDSS Analysis

This directory contains code to calculate the shape distribution of galaxies in SDSS and code to fit models to that shape distribution.


## Samples

We defne multiple galaxy 'samples'.  These samples are defined in bins of r-band k-correct to z=0.1 absolute magnitudes.

* `sample_1` where -17 > M_r0.1 > -18
* `sample_2` where -18 > M_r0.1 > -19
* `sample_3` where -19 > M_r0.1 > -20
* `sample_4` where -20 > M_r0.1 > -21
* `sample_5` where -21 > M_r0.1 > -22
* `sample_6` where -22 > M_r0.1 > -23
