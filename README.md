# Galaxy Shapes

Model and constrain the 3D shapes of galaxies.

## Description

This is a project to model the intrinsic (non-lensed) shapes of galaxies.  The goal is to build physical 3D models that can be constrained with a variety of observations of projected 2D shape information.


## Requirements

This project has a variety of dependenceies used in models and analysis.  These are listed below:

* [Halotools](https://github.com/duncandc/halotools)
* [rotations](https://github.com/duncandc/rotations)
* [stat\_utils](https://github.com/duncandc/stat_utils)
